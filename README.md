Yahtzee XP - Fully Featured Game.

Application uses Learnout & Haupsies TruVoice Speech Synthesization, due to other functionality this application is only compatible on Windows NT 5(Win2k) and Windows NT 5.1(XP). Project was requested by a user of an old version of a 1996 Yahtzee game who wanted to improve an allready addicting game. All graphical resources were not included due to their collective size, however, they are available on request(Photoshop Files, 3DSM 5.1 Dice Model, Bitmaps).
